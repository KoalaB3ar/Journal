Collection of Projects I've Created

Brain Olympics - I wanted to create a program to test our knowledge with math problems

	*This program includes: multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction
	*Challenge: implementing a division problem formula, to consistently give problems that don't have decimals in the final answer
	*Solution: Having a set of numbers that won't produce a decimal in the final answer for example: 2 or 4 and 30 or 8
